# drl-cybergenetics

drl-cybergenetics is a research framework for the use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the context of Cybergenetics, including for the control of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) and co-cultures.

Among others, it includes:
- a CRN and co-cultures custom simulation environments (and soon Gym-like and dm_control-like environments, compatible with high-performance DRL libraries like Baselines and ACME)
- [TensorLow]([url](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow))-based custom implementations of state-of-the-art DRL agents, like DDQN and DDPG 

The custom environments and DRL agents are specified by independent configuration files.
