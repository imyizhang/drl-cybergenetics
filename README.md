# drl-cybergenetics

drl-cybergenetics is a comprehensive package for the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the context of Cybergenetics, including for the control of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) and co-cultures.

Among others, it includes:
- a CRN and co-cultures custom simulation Gym-like environment (and soon fully Gym and dm_control compatible environments)
- implementations of state-of-the-art DRL agents, like DDQN and DDPG
